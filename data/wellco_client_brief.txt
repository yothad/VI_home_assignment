CONTEXT
-------
  WellCo is an employer-sponsored healthcare ecosystem emphasizing digital-first prevention and whole-person health. Members are routinely engaged with materials on nutrition tips, balanced diet, healthy eating, Mediterranean diet, and high fiber meals, alongside guidance for weight management and weight loss. Programs frequently reference BMI, cholesterol, and lipid levels, with education tied to heart health within a broader cardiometabolic framework.

ENGAGEMENT PRIORITIES

  Movement-focused journeys promote sustainable physical activity through exercise, aerobic exercise, strength training, cardio, and cardiovascular fitness. Sleep health is a parallel priority with resources on sleep, sleep hygiene, restorative sleep, and sleep quality, including awareness for sleep apnea. Resilience and wellbeing services address stress, stress management, mindfulness, and meditation to support overall wellness, wellbeing, and mental health.

The goal is to improve adherence to preventive care across these cohorts and to sustain engagement with relevant health content.
